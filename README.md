# Landscape Dynamics
Welcome to the Landscape Dynamics course taught at University of Amsterdam. In
this course, you will work through interactive Python Jupyter Notebooks and
Matlab Live scripts to learn how to perform a standard topographic analysis. 
Most of the analysis is based on TopoToolbox. However, the first practical uses
the Fastscape landscape evlution model.

Follow the instructions in P_Fastscape/fastscape_setup_guide.html to install
Fastscape. Feel free to also check out the official Fastscape website:
https://fastscape.org/

TopoToolbox3 can be downloaded here: https://topotoolbox.github.io/
and Wolfgang Schwanghart has created a helpful blog that can be accessed here
https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/

For every practical you find 2 files. The one without 'key' in the file is the
actual practical, where you need to fill in all the gaps yourself to make the code
run. The other is the practical 'key' where you can look up the potential solution.

Please, report bugs to r.f.ott@uva.nl and feel free to explore my website
